# Learning Machine Learning Course

Learning Machine Learning Course, Bogot√°, Colombia  (&copy; Josh Bloom; June 2019)

## Following along

To *execute* the notebooks with all the dependencies installed, we'll use MyBinder. Here's the stable Binder link:

If those don't work you can follow along using the static notebooks (ie., no kernel environment) at [nbviewer site](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/profjsb/ml_course/tree/master/Lectures/).

## Format
