    "A yacht named \"Columbia\" (not Colombia  üòè) was used to win the [America's Cup in 1958](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_America%27s_Cup). Technology has improved a lot since then. In this breakout, you're going making a predictive model to determine the resistance of a boat given it's geometry and speed. This is usually only measureable with advanced simulations but we can get <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yacht+Hydrodynamics\">7-dimensional data to build a model</a> and then determine this value for arbitrary new boat design:\n",

Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity.
